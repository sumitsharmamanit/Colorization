# Conditional Colorization
-----------------------

Model is based on UNet architecture. It accepts [ l . ab_gray , cue ] as the input.
The 4 channels consist 3 color channel (e.g. Lab format L and ab channel) and a cue image in one channel.   
The cue channel provides 0.1% true pixels and helps model to train efficiently.

The model outputs a 3 channels tensor which is converted into an image of ".png" format.    
The data is augmented prior to the training ( Flip horizontal , Rotate 180 ) to over sample the training dataset.

Please refer to folder_structure.png for the folder structure.

Make sure you have cuda enabled machine. I used AWS Sagemaker to get ready made enviroment.

Instruction to run the code:

1. Check out the code 
   `git clone https://github.com/sumitsharmamanit/Colorization.git`
2. `pip install requirments.txt`
3. Execute training.ipynb notebook file
4. for prediction, use predict.ipynb. There are two modes: 1. bulk prediction 2. single image prediction
5. place the best weight under checkpoints folder
